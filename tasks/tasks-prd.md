### Notes

- Unit tests should typically be placed alongside the code files they are testing (e.g., `MyComponent.tsx` and `MyComponent.test.tsx` in the same directory).
- Use `npx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests. Running without a path executes all tests found by the Jest configuration.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Tasks Needing Review

The following tasks were marked as completed but have been modified to align with the CEMSE description. These need to be reviewed to ensure the current implementation matches the updated requirements:

1. **Task 1.2**: Role-based navigation - INSTRUCTOR role removed, verify navigation works with YOUTH, COMPANIES, INSTITUTION, SUPERADMIN
2. **Task 2.4**: Resume builder - Verify 3 templates are actually implemented
3. **Task 2.6**: File upload - Verify chunked upload system is implemented
4. **Task 3.3**: Job applications - Verify Flow 1 (Company Job Offers) matches description
5. **Task 3.10**: Chat system - Verify integrated chat for job applications is implemented
6. **Task 4.3**: Course structure - Verify hierarchical Course ‚Üí Modules ‚Üí Lessons structure
7. **Task 4.5**: Quiz system - Verify unlimited attempts feature is implemented

### üîç INSTRUCTOR Role Clarification

The INSTRUCTOR role appears in the database schema but is not clearly defined in the main CEMSE description. Based on the schema, it seems instructors are just course instructors (Profile relation to Course), not a separate management role. The main roles should be:
- **YOUTH**: Job-seeking youth
- **COMPANIES**: Companies that post job offers  
- **INSTITUTION**: Institutions (municipalities, NGOs, training centers)
- **SUPERADMIN**: System administrator
