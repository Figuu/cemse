# Profile Creation Fix for Course Creation Issue

## 🐛 Problem Identified

You encountered this error when trying to create a course with an institution user:
```
Error: Institution profile not found. Please create an institution profile first.
```

### Root Cause Analysis:
The course creation API (`/api/courses`) was looking for an institution using this query:
```typescript
const institution = await prisma.institution.findFirst({
  where: { createdBy: session.user.id },  // <-- Problem here!
  select: { id: true }
});
```

**The Issue**: When creating institutions through the super admin, the `createdBy` field was set to the super admin's ID, not the institution user's ID. Additionally, there was no `Profile` record linking the institution user to the institution.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Institution Creation Fix**
Updated `/api/admin/institutions` POST endpoint to create **three records** in a transaction:
- ✅ `User` record (for authentication)
- ✅ `Institution` record (institution data)
- ✅ `Profile` record (links user to institution)

### 2. **Company Creation Fix**
Updated `/api/admin/companies` POST endpoint to create **three records** in a transaction:
- ✅ `User` record (for authentication)
- ✅ `Company` record (company data)
- ✅ `Profile` record (user profile data)

### 3. **Database Transaction**
Used Prisma transactions to ensure all records are created atomically - if any step fails, all changes are rolled back.

## 🔧 Technical Changes Made

### Institution Creation (Before vs After):

#### Before:
```typescript
// Only created Institution record
const institution = await prisma.institution.create({...});
```

#### After:
```typescript
// Creates User + Institution + Profile records
const result = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  // 1. Create User record for authentication
  const user = await tx.user.create({
    data: {
      email,
      password: hashedPassword,
      role: 'INSTITUTION',
      isActive: true,
      firstName: mayorName || name.split(' ')[0],
      lastName: mayorName ? name.split(' ').slice(1).join(' ') : name.split(' ').slice(1).join(' ')
    }
  });

  // 2. Create Institution record
  const institution = await tx.institution.create({
    data: {
      name,
      email,
      password: hashedPassword,
      // ... other institution fields
      createdBy: session.user.id
    }
  });

  // 3. Create Profile record linking user to institution
  const profile = await tx.profile.create({
    data: {
      userId: user.id,
      firstName: mayorName || name.split(' ')[0],
      lastName: mayorName ? name.split(' ').slice(1).join(' ') : name.split(' ').slice(1).join(' '),
      phone,
      address,
      city: department,
      state: region,
      institutionId: institution.id,  // <-- This is the key!
      profileCompletion: 80
    }
  });

  return { user, institution, profile };
});
```

### Company Creation (Similar Pattern):
```typescript
// Creates User + Company + Profile records
const result = await prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
  const user = await tx.user.create({...});
  const company = await tx.company.create({...});
  const profile = await tx.profile.create({
    data: {
      userId: user.id,
      // ... profile data
      profileCompletion: 60
    }
  });
  return { user, company, profile };
});
```

## 🎯 What This Fixes

### Before the Fix:
